Description : The Slums is a text based adventure game, written in Java, set in a world where Sci-Fi and Fantasy fart in the same room.
               The player is able to create their own unique character and take them on an adventure in the fictional city of Keji,
               an industrial era metropolis on a remote island. A city where the buisinessmen downtown walk on polished marble floors,
               while the people less than a kilometer away try to avoid infected needles on the streets while barefoot.
               The player can choose their character's background, whether they want to be an entrepreneur or a blue colar worker,
               each background shows a brief story of what life is like in the city for the different types of people that live there.
               Due to an outbreak of a deadly virus spread through violence, the player's character is quarantined inside of the
               slums and its up to the player to figure a way out before things get worse. Buuuut... While they are trapped
               inside of the slums, the player can enjoy a variety of activities that are common for citizens the slums.


While in the slums the player can:
- Purchase a plethora of weapons to convince those who dissagree with them.
- Buy armour of all kinds to protect their character from unwanted acts of aggression.
- Spend some time at the well with the best lads and get bonkered after a few strong cups of drink.
- Join a violent gang and assimilate into their group to commit crimes as a collective.
- Complete odd jobs to earn doubloons for a shinier knife or a bigger gun.
- Spend their life earnings on one hand at the Ponkler table, or any of the 3 other minigames.
- And of course... try to escape from the slums.
